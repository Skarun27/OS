#### Overview
- **Reverse Proxy Servers** and **Load Balancers** are critical components in client-server architectures, acting as intermediaries to enhance efficiency.
- They can be hardware devices or increasingly software applications on standard hardware.

#### Definitions
- **Reverse Proxy**: Acts as the gateway for requests from clients to servers, forwarding requests to the appropriate server and delivering the server’s response back to the client.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming client requests across multiple servers to balance the load, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed and optimizing response times.

#### Deployment Context
- **Load Balancers**: Essential when a single server cannot handle the volume of requests efficiently or to eliminate single points of failure. They ensure optimal server utilization and improve site reliability.
- **Reverse Proxies**: Beneficial even with a single server setup. They serve as the “public face” of the website, enhancing security and flexibility.

#### Key Functions
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Distributes workload to prevent server overload.
  - Enhances user experience by reducing error rates through server health checks and redirecting requests away from failed servers.
  - Can provide session persistence, directing all requests from a specific client to the same server.

- **Reverse Proxy**:
  - Increases security by hiding backend server details and protecting against direct attacks.
  - Offers scalability and flexibility, allowing backend infrastructure changes without affecting client perception.
  - Supports web acceleration through compression, SSL termination, and caching to speed up response times and reduce backend load.

#### Benefits
- **Security**: Both can improve security—load balancers through health checks and session management, reverse proxies by shielding backend servers and mitigating DDoS attacks.
- **Performance**: Enhance site performance by optimizing server use (load balancers) and reducing load/response times (reverse proxies).
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Load balancers improve reliability by avoiding single points of failure. Reverse proxies allow for backend adjustments without client-side impacts, supporting smooth scaling.

#### When to Use
- **Load Balancer**: When operating multiple servers for high availability or to handle high traffic volumes efficiently.
- **Reverse Proxy**: For single or multiple server setups, to enhance security, flexibility, and site performance.
