**Definition:**
Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that provides a scalable and fault-tolerant method for distributing and accessing data across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

**Key Principles:**
- **Hash Function**: Uses a hash function to map data (keys) and nodes to points on a circular keyspace (hash ring).
- **Data Assignment**: Data items are assigned to the nearest node in the keyspace, ensuring uniform distribution.
- **Minimal Rebalancing**: When nodes are added or removed, only a small portion of data needs to be moved to maintain an even distribution.

**Benefits:**
- **Scalability**: Facilitates easy addition or removal of nodes with minimal data movement and rebalancing.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enhances system reliability by distributing data across multiple nodes, which allows for replication and redundancy.
- **Load Balancing**: Helps prevent hotspots by evenly distributing data across the cluster.

**Operational Mechanisms:**
- **Adding Nodes**: New nodes are assigned a position on the hash ring, taking over responsibility for specific partitions and resulting in minimal data transfer from existing nodes.
- **Data Storage**: Each piece of data is hashed to find its place on the ring, determining which node is responsible for storing it.
- **Partitioning**: The keyspace is divided into fixed-size partitions that are distributed among the nodes, ensuring balanced data distribution.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Hotspots**: Early implementations faced issues with uneven data distribution, which were mitigated by introducing virtual nodes and fixed-size partitions.
- **Data Movement**: Strategies like virtual nodes and partitioning minimize the data movement required when nodes join or leave the system.

**Applications:**
- Used in distributed databases(via sharding), cache systems, and load balancing to manage data storage and retrieval efficiently across a scalable cluster.

**Virtual Nodes:**
- Enhance flexibility and efficiency in data distribution and rebalancing by representing physical nodes with multiple virtual nodes on the hash ring.

**Practical Implications:**
- **Availability**: Supports high availability by allowing the system to continue operations, even when nodes fail or are added.
- **Replication**: Facilitates easy replication of data across nodes for increased fault tolerance.
- **Load Distribution**: Ensures a more equitable distribution of load, reducing the likelihood of overburdening individual nodes.


Clarity on Kafka (partitions concept)-> is it a database and compute together?
shard is a separate server?
