- Tell me about an important lesson you learned over the past year

**Introduction**:"Over the past year, I've traversed from the academic realm back into the professional world at Oracle, and then returned to college to complete and defend my thesis. This journey has been pivotal, teaching me invaluable lessons about adaptability, continuous learning, and the importance of a research-oriented approach in software engineering.

**Transition to Professional Environment**: "My time at Oracle marked my first foray into a purely professional software engineering role outside an academic setting. This experience taught me the critical lesson of adaptability—integrating into a new team with distinct dynamics and expectations. Despite the initial challenges, including my first-time role focusing on frontend development and working with limited resources, I embraced the learning curve. This period of adjustment honed my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies and methodologies, significantly broadening my technical skillset."

**Returning to Academic and Thesis Defense**: "Following my internship, I returned to academia to focus on my thesis, which presented a different set of challenges. The process of researching, writing, and ultimately defending my thesis instilled in me a research-oriented mindset. It was during this time that I learned the power of approaching problems from a research perspective—analyzing them deeply before applying solutions. This experience transformed how I view software engineering; it taught me not to shy away from diving into new technologies or tackling complex problems, regardless of my familiarity with the tools at hand."

**Outcome**: "The combination of these experiences—my internship at Oracle and completing my thesis—has not only bolstered my confidence but also significantly enhanced my problem-solving capabilities. I emerged as a more versatile and effective engineer, equipped with a robust set of skills that enable me to navigate any learning curve efficiently."

**Reflection**: "Reflecting on the past year, the most important lesson I've learned is the value of embracing both the structured approach of the professional world and the open-ended inquiry of academic research. This duality has empowered me to become not just a better problem solver but also a more adaptable and innovative software engineer. It's a testament to the 'Learn and Be Curious' principle, highlighting that our growth as professionals is fueled by continuous learning and the courage to venture into the unknown."



- Tell me about a situation or experience you went through that changed your way of thinking

**Situation**: Before pursuing my Master's degree, I had already developed a strong foundation in problem-solving as a software engineer. However, I realized that my approach was primarily focused on applying known solutions to problems rather than exploring the unknown. This realization came to the forefront when I embarked on my thesis project, an integral part of my Master's program.

**Task**: The task before me was not just to complete my thesis but to engage deeply with the research process from drafting the proposal to presenting my findings. This was a daunting challenge, as it required a level of academic rigor and curiosity I hadn't fully developed in my professional career.

**Action**: I immersed myself in the research process, which began with learning how to effectively draft a research proposal. This initial stage taught me the importance of thorough investigation and clear articulation of ideas and hypotheses. As I delved deeper into my thesis work, I:

- Conducted extensive literature reviews to understand existing research and identify gaps.
- Developed a methodology that was both robust and innovative, pushing the boundaries of my technical skills.
- Engaged with my peers and advisors regularly for feedback, which sharpened my critical thinking and ability to iterate on my work.
- Embraced the challenges of learning new technologies and frameworks necessary for my research, viewing each obstacle as an opportunity to expand my skill set.

**Result**: Completing my thesis transformed my approach to software engineering. It instilled in me a research-oriented mindset, where I no longer hesitate to dive into new technologies or complex problems. The skills and confidence I gained from navigating the research process have empowered me to tackle any learning curve efficiently. This has not only enhanced my problem-solving capabilities but also made me a more versatile and effective engineer.

**Reflection**: This experience fundamentally changed my way of thinking, highlighting the value of curiosity and continuous learning in personal and professional growth. It taught me that the path to becoming a better software engineer is paved with challenges that require not just technical skills but also the willingness to explore and understand the unknown. This aligns with Amazon's Leadership Principle of "Learn and Be Curious," as it underscores the importance of embracing challenges as learning opportunities and continuously seeking to improve oneself. Moving forward, I'm committed to applying this research-oriented approach to all aspects of my work, confident in my ability to learn and adapt in the face of new challenges.



- Tell me about a time when you made a smarter decision with the help of your curiosity

**Situation**: In the midst of developing an Automation Framework—a project with high priority within our organization—we faced a procedural bottleneck. Our process for sharing automation test execution reports during high-level management scrums relied on manually distributing Jenkins URLs for each team, creating dependencies and inefficiencies.

**Task**: I recognized the need for a more streamlined, efficient way to share these reports that could eliminate the manual steps and dependencies involved. My task was to leverage my curiosity to find a solution that could simplify this process and make it more efficient for all teams involved.

**Action**: Motivated by a desire to learn how we could improve our reporting process and driven by my curiosity, I proposed the idea of a centralized dashboard. This solution required me to:

1. **Research**: I delved into existing solutions and technologies that could facilitate the creation of a centralized dashboard for automation test reports.
2. **Collaborate**: Working closely with our DevOps team, I explored various tools and platforms, ultimately selecting one that best fit our needs for real-time data aggregation and display.
3. **Develop and Test**: I took the lead in developing the initial version of the dashboard, incorporating feedback from team members and management to ensure it met our needs.
4. **Implement**: After successful testing with our team's reports, I oversaw the rollout of the dashboard to include daily execution reports from all product teams, ensuring a smooth transition to this new system.

**Result**: The introduction of the centralized dashboard was a significant success. It was enthusiastically received by team members and management alike, leading to its adoption as the standard method for accessing daily execution reports across all teams. This initiative not only streamlined our reporting process, enhancing efficiency and transparency, but also fostered a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
