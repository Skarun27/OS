- Describe a time when you disagreed with the approach of a team member. What did you do?

**Situation**: On a project at RIT during my Master's degree, we were developing a web checkers game as part of our semester project. We had to decide to add an enhancement to our project over MVP, so one of the team members suggested implementing a feature that, in my view, overly complicated the codebase without adding substantial value to the end-user experience. 

**Task**: I believed it was essential to advocate for a simpler, more maintainable solution that aligned with our project goals and deadlines. My task was to communicate my concerns and suggest an alternative approach that I believed was more user-friendly and will be cleaner in our existing design to add. 

**Action**: 

* Respectful Communication: I first approached the team member privately to express my concerns. I made sure to focus on the specific technical aspects of the proposal, avoiding any personal critique. 

* Alternative Solution Presentation: I prepared an alternative solution, which I presented during our team meeting. This included a brief demonstration of how my proposed approach could achieve the same objectives more simply and efficiently. I backed up my proposal with data, including performance metrics and maintainability assessments. 

* Seeking Feedback: I encouraged open discussion and feedback from the entire team, including the team member whose approach I disagreed with. This fostered a collaborative environment where everyone felt their input was valued. 

* Flexibility and Openness to Compromise: While I had strong convictions about my approach, I remained open to integrating useful elements from the original proposal to refine my solution further. 

**Result**: After a thorough discussion, the team decided to adopt a hybrid approach that incorporated the simplicity and efficiency of my solution with a few beneficial aspects from our colleague's proposal. This not only met our project's requirements more effectively but also enhanced team cohesion. The feature was implemented successfully and received positive feedback for its simple design extension and maintainability. 

**Reflection**: This experience reinforced the importance of having backbone when necessary to disagree with a team member's approach but doing so with respect and a focus on the project's best interests. It taught me the value of open communication, collaboration, and being willing to find a middle ground. Ultimately, it demonstrated that constructive disagreement can lead to more innovative solutions and stronger team dynamics.



- Give me an example of something you believe in that nobody else does.

Unlike the traditional view of success and failure as opposites, I see failures as integral steps towards achieving success, containing within them the exact lessons needed to propel a project or idea forward.

This perspective was solidified through my experience in a challenging project where we were trying to integrate a new automation framework to our technology stack. I failed on my first POC where I believed a record and play tool will work. The demonstration of my poc had a lot of open questions, leading to setbacks in my approach. While the initial reaction from the team was a sense of defeat.

We systematically reviewed every setback, identifying not just where things went wrong, but also how these points of failure illuminated aspects of our project we hadn't fully understood before. This process not only helped us build a more robust framework, but also significantly improved our team collaboration.

The belief that 'failures are disguised successes' has guided me to approach problems with a more positive, proactive mindset. It encourages not just resilience, but a kind of intellectual curiosity and openness to learning that I find to be rare. It's a belief that has transformed how I lead teams, approach project challenges, and innovate solutions.



* Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.

**Situation**: In my first leadership role, during an appraisal cycle, I was faced with the challenging task of informing a team member that she would not be receiving a salary increase. This decision was due to a company-wide budget crunch, not her performance, which made the conversation even more difficult as she had been performing well.

**Task**: My task was to communicate this decision to her transparently and empathetically, ensuring she understood the reasons behind it and that it was not a reflection of her contributions to the team.

**Action**: I prepared for the meeting by gathering all relevant information, including the context of the budget constraints and the companyâ€™s plans to address salary adjustments in the future. During the meeting, I was honest and direct about the situation, explaining the broader financial challenges the company was facing and how they impacted the appraisal cycle. I emphasized her value to the team and our appreciation for her hard work. I also discussed non-monetary ways we could support her professional growth and recognize her contributions, such as additional training opportunities and increased responsibilities.

**Result**: Although initially disappointed, she appreciated the transparency and understanding with which the message was delivered. She expressed gratitude for the clear explanation and the acknowledgment of her contributions. This conversation, despite its difficult nature, strengthened our professional relationship and her commitment to the team. She continued to perform excellently, and we were able to review her compensation more favorably in the next cycle.

**Reflection**: This experience taught me the importance of honest and compassionate communication, especially in difficult situations. It reinforced that how a message is delivered can significantly impact its reception and the ongoing motivation and engagement of team members. I learned that being a leader sometimes involves making tough decisions and having challenging conversations, but doing so with empathy and respect can maintain trust and morale.
