- Tell me about a time when you didn't meet customer expectations. What happened, and how did you deal with the situation / Tell me about a time you failed ?

**Situation**: 

While working at Zycus as part of an on-call team responsible for fixing client-reported issues within the Service Level Agreement (SLA), I encountered a situation where I was tasked with addressing a high-priority issue and simultaneously assigned to ship a Customer-Specific Change Request (CSCR) for a wrong order placed by a client. This order correction was critical for the client as they needed it to be part of their current sales quarter for audit purposes.

**Task**:

My task was to quickly generate and test a query to correct the order and ensure it met the client's urgent deadline, all while managing another high-priority issue.

**Action**: 

In my eagerness to address both tasks efficiently, I quickly created and locally tested the query for the CSCR without thoroughly verifying the order and product IDs. Believing it to be correct, I submitted the deliverables and closed the ticket. However, the ticket was reopened by the client due to verification failure; the query I provided contained incorrect IDs from the other issue I was working on, leading to an incorrect order correction and further complicating the situation. Realizing my mistake, I owned up to it and, along with my team, performed a rollback of the initial query and submitted a new, corrected query.

**Result**: 

This experience was a significant learning point early in my on-call role, ==highlighting the importance of meticulous attention to detail, especially when working under pressure. I learned the value of double-checking my work and the impact of my actions on client satisfaction and trust.== Following this incident, I adopted a more diligent approach to delivering work, consistently achieving a 95% success rate on our SLAs over two years. My commitment to high standards and continuous improvement was recognized during my tenure, and upon leaving the company after 3.5 years, I emphasized the importance of never taking shortcuts, especially in production environments, during my knowledge transfer sessions. This experience solidified my understanding of Ownership, Learning and Curiosity, and Insisting on the Highest Standards, principles that I've carried forward in my professional journey.
  


* How do you go about prioritizing customer needs when you are dealing with a large number of customers?

In dealing with a large number of customers, my first step is to understand and categorize their needs based on urgency and impact, using a severity matrix. This approach allows me to address critical issues that affect customer satisfaction and business operations first. I rely on customer data and feedback to inform these priorities, ensuring decisions are both data-driven and aligned with our strategic goals. Effective communication is key; I ensure customers are informed about the status of their requests, setting realistic expectations. For instance, at my previous job, I was once asked to join to the call where the stakeholders wanted me to deliver a task on priority, however, I had other tasks in my bucket that were of more priroity and severity and so I set a clear communication with my manager about the priority of the highlighted issue and eventually we reached on a consensus on the project delivery timeline. Continuous feedback loops with customers and internal teams help refine this process, ensuring we're always improving and meeting our customers' evolving needs.
